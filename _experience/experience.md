<!-- Research experience
====== -->

<!-- In academia, I focus on hypothesizing, researching, publishing papers, and teaching to advance the field of knowledge.

In industry, I focus on developing new products and technologies, applying science to solve problems in the marketplace, and working with team members to create innovative solutions that will benefit the company financially.

I am also trying to bridge the gap between academic research and industry research needs. -->
