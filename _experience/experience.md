In academia, I focus on hypothesizing, conducting research, publishing papers, and teaching to advance the field of knowledge.

In industry, I concentrate on developing new products and technologies, applying science to solve marketplace problems, and collaborating with team members to create innovative solutions that will benefit the company financially.

I am also working to bridge the gap between academic research and industry research needs.
