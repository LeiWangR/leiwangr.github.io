<h2>Ongoing Supervision</h2>

I am currently a registered Higher Degree by Research (HDR) supervisor at Griffith University, holding transitional status.

As part of my role at Griffith University, specifically through the TIME@ARC Hub&Griffith, I have begun supervising research assistants, research interns, Master of Philosophy (MPhil) students, and Doctoral (PhD) candidates in both **co-principal and principal supervision** capacities.

<h2>Completed Supervision</h2>

I have successfully supervised more than ten final-year research students, including master’s, honours, and interns, most of whom have produced arXiv preprints or publications in leading conferences such as ICLR, NeurIPS, and ICML. Their research spans video understanding, temporal modeling, and trustworthy AI. <font color="blue">First appointment following supervision noted.</font>
