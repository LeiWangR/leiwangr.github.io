Lei Wang serves as a Research Fellow at the School of Computing, within the ANU College of Engineering, Computing, and Cybernetics. He is under the guidance of [Assoc. Prof. Liang Zheng](https://zheng-lab.cecs.anu.edu.au/) (ANU) and [Prof. Tom Gedeon](https://staffportal.curtin.edu.au/staff/profile/view/tom-gedeon-5e48a1fd/) (Curtin University).

Currently, he also holds the position of Computer Scientist at Active Intelligence Australia Pty Ltd in Perth. In this role, he leads research and development efforts in the field of commercial anomaly detection solutions. His project has successfully raised 1.2 million US dollars, and as a result, he was awarded the Incentive Unit Award.

In addition to his academic and research responsibilities, Lei Wang also contributes to the field as a Visiting Scientist in the Machine Learning Research Group (MLRG) at Data61 (formerly NICTA), a division of The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).

Since 2018, Lei has been dedicated to his work as a full-time Computer Vision Researcher with iCetana Pty Ltd in Perth. During this time, he also acted as a Visiting Researcher in MLRG at Data61/CSIRO and contributed as a Visiting Researcher with the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering at The University of Western Australia (UWA).

Prior to commencing his PhD at ANU and Data61/CSIRO, Lei received several competitive full PhD scholarships, including the ARC Industrial Transformation Training Centre Scholarship, UWA International Fee Scholarship, University Postgraduate Award, Data61 PhD Scholarship, Data61 Top-up Scholarship, and ANU HDR Fee Remission Merit Scholarship.

Throughout his PhD candidature, Lei authored a significant number of first-author papers published in esteemed venues, such as CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, ACM MM, TPAMI, and TIP. His research, conducted under the guidance of [Dr. Piotr Koniusz](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~koniusz/) (Data61/CSIRO & ANU), earned him the Sang Uk Lee Best Student Paper Award from ACCV'22.

Lei's research interests encompass a wide range of topics, including action recognition in videos, anomaly detection, video image processing, one- and few-shot learning, deep learning, tensor learning, and domain adaptation.

He is an active member of both IEEE and ACM as a Student Member.
