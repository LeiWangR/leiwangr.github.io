Lei Wang is an [ARC Hub](https://science.desi.qld.gov.au/research/capability-directory/research-hub-driving-farming-productivity-disease-prevention) Research Fellow (Grade 2) in the School of Engineering and Built Environment — Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Griffith University, working under the guidance of [Prof. Yongsheng Gao](https://experts.griffith.edu.au/19112-yongsheng-gao) ([2025 ARC Industry Laureate Fellow](https://www.arc.gov.au/2025-industry-laureate-profile-professor-yongsheng-gao), Griffith University) and [Prof. Piotr Koniusz](https://www.koniusz.com) (Data61/CSIRO & ANU & UNSW). He is also a Visiting Scientist at Data61/CSIRO. He originally founded the Temporal Intelligence and Motion Extraction ([TIME](https://time.griffith.edu.au/)) Lab at ANU, leading a dynamic team of master’s and honours students in machine learning and computer vision research. The lab has since transitioned to the [ARC Research Hub](https://www.griffith.edu.au/griffith-sciences/farming-productivity) at Griffith University, where it is now an integral part of the Hub and the broader Griffith research community.

Previously, he was a Research Fellow (Level B) in the School of Computing at the ANU College of Engineering, Computing, and Cybernetics, working with [Assoc. Prof. Liang Zheng](https://zheng-lab-anu.github.io) (ANU) and [Prof. Tom Gedeon](https://staffportal.curtin.edu.au/staff/profile/view/tom-gedeon-5e48a1fd/) (Curtin University). He also served as a Visiting Scientist in the Machine Learning Research Group (MLRG) at Data61/CSIRO. During this period, he successfully supervised three master's and three honours students on their final-year research projects at the TIME Lab, mentoring them in high-quality research. Some of their work was published in top-tier machine learning conferences, such as NeurIPS, ICLR, and ICML.

Since 2018, he has worked as a full-time Computer Vision Researcher at iCetana Pty Ltd in Perth. He has also held Visiting Researcher positions at MLRG, Data61/CSIRO, and the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering at The University of Western Australia (UWA). In 2021, he joined Active Intelligence Australia Pty Ltd as a Computer Scientist, leading research and development in commercial anomaly detection solutions. His project successfully secured $1.2 million USD in funding, earning him the Incentive Unit Award.

Before pursuing his PhD at ANU and Data61/CSIRO, Lei received several prestigious PhD scholarships, including the ARC Industrial Transformation Training Centre Scholarship, UWA International Fee Scholarship, University Postgraduate Award, Data61 PhD Scholarship, Data61 Top-up Scholarship, and ANU HDR Fee Remission Merit Scholarship. During his PhD, he authored multiple first-author papers published in top-tier venues such as CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, ACM MM, TPAMI, IJCV, and TIP. His research, supervised by [Prof. Piotr Koniusz](https://www.koniusz.com) (Data61/CSIRO & ANU & UNSW), earned him the Sang Uk Lee Best Student Paper Award at ACCV 2022.

His research interests include human motion and video understanding, temporal and few-shot representation learning, generative motion, multimodal intelligence, and human-centric AI.
